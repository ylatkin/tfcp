# Twofold arithmetic

This repository is still empty. Here I would publish my codes for something that I call "*Twofold arithmetic*".  

Twofold arithmertic must help debugging accumulation of rounding error in floating-point computations.  
See details at my Web page [https://sites.google.com/site/yevgenylatkin/twofold-arithmetic](https://sites.google.com/site/yevgenylatkin/twofold-arithmetic)
